    r"""Compute monotonic attention distribution from choosing probabilities.
    Monotonic attention implies that the input sequence is processed in an
    explicitly left-to-right manner when generating the output sequence.  In
    addition, once an input sequence element is attended to at a given output
    time step, elements occurring before it cannot be attended to at subsequent
    output time steps.  This function generates attention distributions
    according to these assumptions. For more information, see `Online and
    Linear-Time Attention by Enforcing Monotonic Alignments`.
    Args:
        p_choose_i: Probability of choosing input sequence/memory element i.
            Should be of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length), and should
            all be in the range [0, 1].
        previous_attention: The attention distribution from the previous output
            time step.  Should be of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length).
            For the first output time step, `previous_attention[n]` should be
            `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0] for all n in [0, ... batch_size - 1]`.
        mode: How to compute the attention distribution.
            Must be one of ``"recursive"``, ``"parallel"``, or ``"hard"``:
            - ``"recursive"`` recursively computes the distribution.
              This is slowest but is exact, general, and does not suffer
              from numerical instabilities.
            - ``"parallel"`` uses parallelized cumulative-sum and
              cumulative-product operations to compute a closed-form
              solution to the recurrence relation defining the attention
              distribution. This makes it more efficient than
              ``"recursive"``, but it requires numerical checks which make
              the distribution non-exact. This can be a problem in
              particular when input sequence is long and/or
              :attr:`p_choose_i` has entries very close to 0 or 1.
            - ``"hard"`` requires that the probabilities in
              :attr:`p_choose_i` are all either 0 or 1, and subsequently
              uses a more efficient and exact solution.
    Returns:
        A tensor of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length) representing the
        attention distributions for each sequence in the batch.
    Raises:
        ValueError: mode is not one of ``"recursive"``, ``"parallel"``,
